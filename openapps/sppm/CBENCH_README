Some notes about sPPM in Cbench:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Options for building sPPM are specified in Makefile.cbench.  

 * The problem size for sPPM is defined in iq.cbench.h, which is then symlinked 
   in the source tree as iq.h before sppm is built.  The default problem size 
   will run at 1.2-1.4 GB/thread, depending on the number of threads

 * sync.cbench.h is necessary to avoid an error in the stock sync.h when built 
   with certain compilers. It is symlinked in the source tree as sync.h before 
   sppm is built.
