README for handling sweep3d input files

sweep3d requires a file named 'input' to be in the current working directory of the script or executable running the 'sweep' executable.

The 'input' file can either be an actual file or a symbolic link to an actual file of the following form:

file input.150.16proc:

4 4 10 3 2
150 150 150 6 1
.1 .1 .1 -12.0
0 0 0
0 1 -7

The Cbench cbench_gen_jobs.pl script will look for a file or symlink named 'input' in the testset directory ($CBENCHTEST/sweep3d/) and will make a symlink to the input file in each of the individual job directories that it creates.  

Failure to create or link an 'input' file in $CBENCHTEST/sweep3d/ will result in an error and aborted execution of the cbench_gen_jobs.pl script.
