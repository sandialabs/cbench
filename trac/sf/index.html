<br>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cbench">Cbench's</a> goal is to be a relatively straightforward collection of tests, benchmarks, applications, utilities, and framework to hold them together with the goal to facilitate scalable testing, benchmarking, and analysis of a Linux parallel compute cluster. It grew gradually out of frustration having to redo the same work over and over as new Linux clusters were being integrated and brought online. I've continually found labor intensive tasks in cluster integration that could be assissted so that labor could be applied to the true goals of system integration, i.e. getting the system tested and debugged. As this toolkit has grown, it has opened the doors to more sophisticated system integration, testing, and characterization capabilities.

The Cbench TRAC site is currently being migrated to the new Sourceforge Web service setup. The current problem is a memory limiting issue with the new web service virtualized environment.
