		CBENCH REVISION HISTORY
        
A __brief__ summary of changes in each release of Cbench.

* upcoming Cbench release (1.1.5)
	* fix a bug with the HPL/HPCC N parameter calulation when using > 1ppn
	* make the default hpcc input deck match that of linpack
	* Marcus Epperson added the mpiGraph benchmark, by Adam Moody of LLNL,
	  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpigraph. The crunch_mpiGraph utility
	  can be used to generate an HTML report from mpiGraph run output.
	* added OSU messsage rate benchmark
	* changed the IO testset to be a stress test of the
	  parallel filesystem
	* adding the IOSANITY to be used as a sanity checker
	  of parallel filesystems, but not necessarily stressful
	* Build some openmp versions of streams if we are using Intel compilers
	* honor RPATH and BLASLIB set in the environment if
	  found which allows one to recompile with a different
	  BLAS linkage w/o doing any editing
	* some under the covers openmpi 1.2.X specific support
	* added the --waitall option for --throttledbatch mode which will keep 
	  start_jobs from exiting until all jobs have exited the batch system
	* add binary identifier support (--binident parameter) which analogous to
	  test identifiers but for organizing multiple sets binaries in a Cbench
	  testing tree
	* update the --ident parameter to accept comma separated lists
	* fixed a bug with --repeat when combined with with --throttledbatch
	  or --serialbatch modes of start_jobs*
	* added a --polldelay option for --throttledbatch/--serialbatch mode
	* added more variations to compile streams
	* more improvements to the Cbench testing tree rpm capabilities
	* Adding initial (but working) support for 'yod' job launcher and 'pbspro'
	  batch system
	* Marcus Epperson added the very nice HPCC debug build which
	  allows one to select on the command line which hpcc tests to run
	* change the running as root/non-root logic to be smarter in node-level
	  testing and not depend on privelege escelation

* Cbench 1.1.4
    o upgraded NPB support to use version 3.2.1
	o added PSNAP OS noise measurement code from LANL
	o added STREAM2 benchmark
	o added the 'stress' UNIX OS system stress testing utility and
	  included it in the standard NODEHWTEST node-level testing
	o added NPB serial testing to NODEHWTEST test set
	o added colorized text output to several key Cbench utilities
	o switched Cbench self-contained (standalone) MPICH to use ch_shmem
	o reverted to MPICH 1.2.6 for Cbench self-contained (standalone) MPI
	o output_parse scripts --ident parameter accecpts comma separated test
	  identifier lists now
	o output_parse scripts support --minprocs and --maxprocs params
	o workaround in output_parse_generic.pl for Perl<->Glibc memory allocation
	  weirdness with large raw output files
	o the Cbench test tree can now be used completely standalone:
		- binaries are installed into a single 'bin' directory instead of scattering
		the test binaries throughout the tree
		- the 'tools' directory is installed into the test tree
		- Cbench standalone MPI is installed into the test tree if built
	o added tools/make_skel_testset.pl utility script to allow easy creation of
	  a test set skeleton with appropriate generic utility scripts
	o upgraded IOR to version 2.9.0
	o upgraded iozone to version 3_263
	o added --maxmem parameter to node_hw_test script for overriding the free
	  memory detection algorithm
	o added the capability to the NODEHWTEST test set to deal with hw_test modules
	  that require root privelges to run correctly (like memtester and iozone)
	o added a new mode for starting jobs called --throttledbatch; it allows you to
	  control the number of simultaneous running+queued jobs Cbench will allow in
	  the batch system at once
	o added the capability to plot statistical distributions (aka dplot) of data
	  using the 'dplot' utility from Egan Ford's STAB toolkit
	o fixes to mpi_overhead.c to handle negative memory dececrease cases (i.e. memory
	  increase after MPI_init)
	o several new capabilities added to output_parse_generic.pl such as: PNG file
	  output, persistent gnuplot windows, data normalization, additional plotlines
	  specified on the command line, range control, collapsing of multiple test
	  identifier data into a single set of data, key placement control...
	o added a handly script tools/runsizes_list.pl that allows you to build comma-
	  separated lists of runsizes that you can use with the --runsizes parameter
	  of gen_jobs to generate custom runsize sets
	o catch HPLinpack allocation failures and flag them during output parsing
	o removed TODO file from source distribution (the TODO list is now on the Cbench
	  TRAC website)
	o added doc/ListOfSoftware as a new file mirrored from the Cbench wiki
	o Changed the implementation of the custom parse filters to be multple Perl module
	  files specified by the @parse_filter_include array in cluster.def; modules can
	  easily be excluded or included by commenting out/in
	o added OSU mpi benchmarks to the BANDWIDTH test set
	o added an MPI message rate data point to the BANDWIDTH test set
	o added support for running HPlinpack as a node-level test (i.e. added an xhpl.pm
	  hw_test module)
	o added --statsmode to output_parse_generic.pl to dump out a more statistically
	  oriented tabular output
	o Added the --grepable option to output_parse_generic.pl to output gathered data
	  in a grep friendly fashion
	o rename data metrics generated by the hpcc.pm output_parse module to be more
	  consistent with what the HPCC website names them
	o make CBENCHTEST environment variable a requirement; if it's not defined and you do
	  a "make itests" as root, your /bin directory will be forcibly removed...this is not
	  good!
	o undo several implicit path assumptions
	o added the 'nodehwtest' top-level Makefile target which takes care of building
	  everything needed for node-level testing (i.e. the nodehwtest test set) and
	  nothing more (e.g. no MPI builds occur)
	o added the output_parse_customparse.pl script to allow usage of the custom parse
	  filters without having to use the full output parsing framework
	o added the rather nifty single_node_benchmark.pl script which uses various
	  benchmarks and capabilities in Cbench for the singular purpose of benchmarking
	  a single node and generating a nice PDF report of the data
    o better support for the new realms of running greater than 2 ppn (processes per node)
	  and for the new multi-core landscape
	o started adding support for 'binary identifiers' which are very similar in
	  concept to test identifiers but used for cleanly and dynamically managing multiple
	  sets of test binaries
	o several minor changes and under-the-cover capabilities to support the new Fixit123
	  Hardware Qualification/Requalification Framework
	o clean up some minor compile annoyances in various sources
	o many other small bugfixes and tweaks....

* Cbench 1.1.3
	o add CBENCHTEST environment variable to easily support multiple
	  Cbench testing trees
	o Completely new output parsing framework that moves from a bunch of
	  individual scripts to a core script that utilizes output parsing
	  modules. The output parsing modules are responsible for each
	  benchmark/test that Cbench will support output parsing. The core
	  output parsing script was updated with much more analysis capabilities.
	o custom parse filters add the capability to define custom regex matches
	  and an associtated string that the core output parser code will apply
	  while parsing output files. This allows you to define custom errors on
	  the fly that you want to see flagged by the output parsers.
	o redid how the stdout/stderr is grabbed for interactively run jobs making
	  it easier to write job templates and have them just work
	o all Cbench generated jobs are now contained in their own directory versus
	  many job files in a single directory
	o new --repeat, --procs, and --batchargs  parameters used by the start_jobs
	  scripts
	o new scaling study test sets
		- mpisanity (tests the sanity of MPI code on a cluster)
		- hpcc (HPC Challenge)
	o fully implemented all partially implemented testsets
		- io, latency, collective, mpioverhead
	o support for IOR parallel filesystem benchmark in the 'io' testset
	o added the ability to use Cbench testing trees completely isolated from
	  the Cbench main source tree
	o upgraded hpcc to version 1.0.0
	o remove more code duplication in the *gen_jobs scripts
	o support for using OpenMPI as a joblaunch method
	o Lots of bugfixes and tweaks from ongoing Thunderbird cluster work
	
* Cbench 1.1.2
	o !!! Formally approved GPL v2 licensed opensource release !!!
	o Removed GOTO BLAS libs from Cbench distribution (we cannot distribute)
	o improved job template generation structure; added common_header
	  and common_footer templates
	o several cleanups, bugfixes, and improvements by Marcus
	o some under-the-hood changes to remove some code duplication
	  (*_start_jobs and *_gen_jobs scripts)
	o new rotate_latency benchmark
	o added three new scaling study test sets (w/o output parsing support yet)
	  - io
	  - latency
	  - collective
	o HPlinpack updated with very helpful (for long runs anyway) timestamping
	  output in ASYOUGO outputs
	o several small Tbird derived bugfixes and tweaks
	o about 70% done with the revamped output parsing structure, but not
	  using it as the default yet

* Cbench 1.1.1
	o the nodehwtest capabilities received numerous upgrades and tweaks
      to facilitate testing of a 4096+ node cluster including full
      integration as a test set (i.e. *_start_jobs.pl and *_gen_jobs.pl
      scripts were written), support for batch submission of node-level
      tests (supports Torque only at this point) in addition to the default
      remote execution method (i.e. pdsh via ssh), offloading of startup
      work for remotely executed node-level test jobs (i.e. make the remote
      execution start-up MUCH more scalable), more diags (cachebench, mpqc,
      hpcc using a local Cbench ch_p4 compile of mpich), more fine grained
      control of what nodes to include/exclude in testing
	o transitioned to a separate CBench tree for opensource applications
 	  such as LAMMPS
	o added MPQC as a semi-supported opensource application; the nodehwtest
      capabilities can use MPQC as non-MPI node-level test to some extent
    o lots of tweaks and bugfixes as a result of the Thunderbird cluster
      integration
    o *_start_jobs.pl scripts are all pretty much dumb shells now as all
      the core functionality is in the Cbench library
    o fixed bugs in the N value computation for the linpack test set
    o added the mpi_overhead benchmark to measure the amount of memory
      consumed by MPI to do MPI_init(); rolled the 'mpioverhead' test
      set to generate nice graphs of MPI memory overhead scaling and MPI
      job launch time scaling
    o changed cluster.def to have $memory_per_node config paramater
      instead of $memory_per_processor

* Cbench 1.1
	o nodehwtest capabilities added to facilitate scalable node-level
	  testing, i.e. testing on a single node w/o any assumptions about
      system-level integration or MPI
    o added 'rotate' test set (rotate is a cross-sectional MPI bandwidth
      benchmark developed at Sandia Labs)
    o added NAS Parallel Benchmark (aka 'npb') test set
	o added several new benchmarks into the opensource area including
      OSU MPI benchmarks, Intel MPI Benchmarks v2.3, IOR, PIOB, HPCC

* Cbench 1.0
	o implemented the core Cbench infrastructure, such as cbench.pl
      and cluster.def
    o formalized the idea of test sets and implemented a couple:
      the 'bandwidth' and 'linpack' test sets
    o all the existing Cbench scripts were rewritten using the Cbench
      trio of scripts test harness methodology (*_gen_jobs.pl,
      *_start_jobs.pl,*_output_parse.pl)
    o a couple of the output parsing scripts were updated with dynamic
      GNUplot generation capabilities
    
* Cbench 0.9
	o first semi-official tagging off Cbench code
    o just a loose collection of scripts and a small amount
      of build framework at this point
