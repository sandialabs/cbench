= HOWTO: Make a New Cbench Testset =

* create a new install script in sbin
  * copy a generic one like install_mpioverhead
    * most testsets are able to use the generic gen and start scripts
    * all testsets use the same modularized output_parse_generic.pl script for output parsing functionality
  * modify the $testset var
  * modify the @files array to pickup the binaries and other files your testset will need
    * these lines are generic unless you need something different
{{{
    "tools/$testset\*.pl",
    "templates/$testset\*.in",
}}}

* create job templates in templates directory
  * use a fairly generic template like templates/bandwidth_beff.in as your starting point
  * use the naming form TESTSETNAME_JOBNAME.in
    * ex: mpisanity_routecheck.in
    * ex: mpisanity_imb.in
* write output_parse module(s) for any new benchmarks/tests/apps that are used in the testset
  * see [wiki:doc/HOWTO-MakeNewOutputParseModule]
* then run/sbin/install_yournewtestset and the cbench testing tree should have your new testset
