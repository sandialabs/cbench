== Batch Systems ==
 * Torque (OpenPBS successor) - http://www.clusterresources.com/pages/products/torque-resource-manager.php
   * supports --throttledbatch mode of starting jobs
 * PBS Pro
   * supports --throttledbatch mode of starting jobs
   * NOTE: this is probably somewhat specific to Cray XT3 setups
 * Slurm (Cbench version 1.2.x code)
   * supports --throttledbatch mode of starting jobs
 * Moab Msub (Cbench version 1.2.x code)

== Job Launchers ==
 * mpiexec - http://www.osc.edu/~pw/mpiexec/index.php
   * supports rank-to-node mapping resolution (have to use mpiexec with -v to have the proper output)
 * mpirun (MPICH derived varieties)
 * openmpi - OpenMPI !RunTime Environment (ORTE), ''orterun'' command - http://www.open-mpi.org
 * yod - job launching environment from Cray XT3/XT4 systems
 * slurm (srun is the actual command) (Cbench version 1.2.x code)
   * see [wiki:doc/HOWTO-UsingSlurm]

== Remote Command Execution ==
 * pdsh - http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdsh/
