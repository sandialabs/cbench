[wiki:doc/HOWTO-CheckoutOpenAppsTree Check it out first].

Build linkage requirements:
 * LAMMPS - needs correct FFTW and BLAS for linkage
 * HPCCG - nothing additional needed
 * Trilinos - needs BLAS and LAPACK for linkage

FFTW linkage can be edited in make.def directly (search for FFTWLIB to see the logic).  Alternatively you can specify FFTW_LIB and FFTW_INCLUDE in the environment and make.def should pick it up correctly in most cases.

LAPACK linkage can be edit in make.def directly (search for LAPACKLIB to see the logic).  If your BLASLIB environment variable points to a library setup that has LAPACK (like linking with ACML for BLAS), you can set LAPACKLIB like:
{{{
export LAPACKLIB=" "
}}}

Compile it all:
{{{
% cd /path/to/openapps
% make
% make install
}}}

Compile something specific:
{{{
% cd /path/to/openapps
% make -C lammps
% make -C lammps install
}}}

Binaries and such will now be installed in $CBENCHOME/bin.  Now we need to install/update to the Cbench Testing Tree:
{{{
% cd $CBENCHOME
% make itests
}}}
