# This module contains custom parse filters that will optionally be
# employed by the Cbench output parsers when looking at job output.
# With these filters, the user can dynamically tell the output parsers
# to look for user-defined errors. These filters are only used when
# the --customparse parameter is given to the *_output_parse.pl scripts.
#
# Each filter is composed of a key/value pair.  The key is is a Perl
# regular expression including capturing. The value is a string that will
# be used to identify when an occurrence of the regex is found. The value
# can include the $1,$2,... etc variables that would be captured by
# the Perl regular expression
#
# The %parse_filter_include hash in cluster.def controls which parse
# filter modules are used by the output parsing engine.
#
# These parse filters are for miscellaneous things
