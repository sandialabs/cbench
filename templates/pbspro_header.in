# Directives for PBS Pro
# NOTE: Torque seems to require that these directives be
#       first, I imagine PBS Pro does too...
#
# For the time being the only PBS Pro setup I've used is the Cray
# XT3/XT4 setup on Sandia's Red Storm system.  I'm not sure if PBS
# Pro in general uses the 'size' attribute instead of 'nodes'. 
# For sure, 'size' is required instead of 'nodes' on Red Storm though.
#PBS -l size=NUM_NODES_HERE
#
#PBS -l walltime=WALLTIME_HERE
#
# other attributes you might use but are hidded from PBS Pro processing
#HIDE -q somequeue
#HIDE -A 70400/01.01.02
