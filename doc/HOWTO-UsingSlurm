The biggest thing to note here is that the jobluanch_method will change depending on the MPI you are using with SLURM.

 * For '''Cbench + Openmpi''', use this in cluster.def:
{{{
#!perl
$joblaunch_method = "openmpi";
# ...
$batch_method = "slurm";
}}}

 * For '''Cbench + Mvapich''', use this in cluster.def:
{{{
#!perl
$joblaunch_method = "slurm";
# ...
$batch_method = "slurm";
}}}

 * For '''Cbench + Mvapich2''', use this in cluster.def:
{{{
#!perl
$joblaunch_method = "slurm";
# ...
$joblaunch_cmd = "srun --mpi=none";
# ...
$batch_method = "slurm";
}}}
